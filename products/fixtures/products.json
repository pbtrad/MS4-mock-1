            "description": "The D-18 Modern Deluxe is a new take on Martin Vintage. This guitar is packed with custom features and modern technology that you have to see, feel, and hear for yourself. The vintage appointments include a Sitka spruce Vintage Tone System (VTS) top, a dovetail neck joint, and natural protein glue construction that give it the rich, fully aged Martin tone that has inspired generations. The look is unlike anything in our production line to date with East Indian rosewood binding, stylish gold frets, gold open-gear tuners, and a unique 1930s style script logo inlaid in pearl on the headstock. Some ultra-modern features include a titanium truss rod, Liquidmetal® bridge pins with red dots, and a composite carbon fiber bridgeplate that boosts volume without adding weight. And we’ve included a new neck shape that is slightly asymmetrical for maximum hand comfort up and down the fretboard. This guitar is anything but standard.",

            "description": "Beginning with a choice of Bubinga from West Africa, the shells in this drum kit are thinner in nature to allow the unique tonal character of these exotic hardwoods to truly shine. The plies of each shell (8 for snares and kicks, 6 for toms,) are cross-laminated in an alternating vertical/horizontal grain pattern. This allows the outer shell to showcase the natural splendor of the wood through a glass-like lacquer finish. The hand-stained inner shell of each drum creates a smooth conduit for vibration and sound to travel through, delivering tone that will ignite an almost emotional response every time it is played. Accented further with classic tube-style lugs, die-cast hoops, and a variety of unique set-ups, Dios Series drums echo the call for a new percussive tradition, set by the players of the New Revolution. The rich texture of Dios series 100% African Bubinga shells is unparalleled. Although its colour and grain carries a dark visual appearance, its tonal body is bright and focused, projecting with unparelleled attack and volume. This is due to the harder nature of the wood and heaviness of the shell. It speaks with a voice that is delicate, yet explosive. Shimmering highs and channeled lows are the hallmark of its character. This is definitely one that must be played to be believed. ",

The vintage appointments include a Sitka spruce Vintage Tone System (VTS) top, a dovetail neck joint, and natural protein glue construction that give it the rich, fully aged Martin tone that has inspired generations. The look is unlike anything in our production line to date with East Indian rosewood binding, stylish gold frets, gold open-gear tuners, and a unique 1930s style script logo inlaid in pearl on the headstock. Some ultra-modern features include a titanium truss rod, Liquidmetal® bridge pins with red dots, and a composite carbon fiber bridgeplate that boosts volume without adding weight. And we’ve included a new neck shape that is slightly asymmetrical for maximum hand comfort up and down the fretboard. This guitar is anything but standard.",
